Authors: Gianvito Losapio, Marco Mussi, Alberto Maria Metelli, Marcello Restelli

## Description
The code is composed of two different folders, each containing a specific algorithm implementation.

- :open_file_folder: **distributed_q_learning** contains the code for the Distributed Q Learning algorithm (DQL)
- :open_file_folder: **state_action_factorization** contains the code for the State and Action Factorization algorithm (SAF)

In the following, the code of the two algorithms will be presented separately.
